# Your Personal Comic Library

Now I'm glad to announce that FINALLY the 1.0.0 version is released. It contains (probably) **TONs** of bugs, even in its skele**TON** structure.

Forget that pun. But I have to warn you the project is **NOT fully tested**, so it may **crash down** or do something unexpected.

Sadly, I'm not skilled enough to steal your privacy :) . So you can expect that the project won't do harm to your computer except those you loaded into the library (may be crupped by undetected bugs).

Hope my code good enough to bring you some convenience or at least some funny jokes about mysterious crash down.
